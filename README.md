<h1>Hi! I'm Jacqueline 👾</h1>
</div>

I'm a junior front-end web developer from Chile! Learning and helping people learn are some of my biggest passions, so I love working in teams and I'm always looking for new challenges or problems to solve. I have many hobbies! Traveling ✈️, poetry 📖, crochetting 🧶, cooking 🍝, videogames 🎮, boardgames 🎲, and of course, coding 💻! My latest obsession is competitive programming and I'm currently learning python to dive deeper into it 🤓
